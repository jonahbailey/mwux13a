				%h3 Christina Wodtke
				%p Christina Wodtke has an impressive history of making things happen. Most recently she led the creation of a social network/gaming platform as a General Manager of Zynga.com. Before Zynga, she held senior positions at Myspace, LinkedIn and Yahoo!, back when Yahoo! was pretty neat. Currently she lives the slow life: advising start-ups, teaching, and speaking at conferences worldwide.
