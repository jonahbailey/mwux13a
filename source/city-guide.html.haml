					%h3 Why Grand Rapids?
					%p Grand Rapids boasts one of the highest rates of designers per capita in the country. This is less surprising when you consider the city’s long history in automotive, furniture and architectural design. In fact, Grand Rapids is still known as the office-furniture capital of the world—home to Steelcase, Herman Miller and Haworth, as well as other smaller furniture companies.

					%h3 Grand Rapids: The Midwest's Best Kept Secret
					%p Grand Rapids has long had a focus on the arts and, maybe more importantly, volunteerism. The city has hosted an annual Festival of The Arts since 1970, which according to the Library of Congress, is the largest all volunteer arts festival in the United States. During the three days of the event nearly 20,000 volunteers host over half a million people on downtown streets. MWUX13 itself is 100% volunteer-based—its organizers are not compensated for their time or efforts.
					%p In addition to Festival of The Arts, Grand Rapids also hosts ArtPrize, a radically open art competition, and one of the world’s most generous. Over the course of three years, ArtPrize has hosted 4,557 artists in 515 venues around the downtown area and given away $1,428,000 in prizes.
