			%h4 Hey there!
			%p We couldn't be more excited to welcome you to Grand Rapids this week for Midwest UX 2013. We're thrilled with the speakers, venues, excursions, hospitality and the opportunities we'll have to connect over the three days. We think you'll agree that Midwest UX will once again provide a tremendous conference experience you'll remember for years to come.

			%p With just days to go before you arrive in Grand Rapids, we want to make sure you have all the information you need to prepare for the best conference experience possible. If you have any further questions, or if there is any additional way we can serve you as you arrive, please don't hesitate to <a href="/team">contact us</a>.

			%h4 What to Wear

			%p This week, fall colors are nearing their peak and there may be an autumn chill in the air so consider bringing an umbrella, a jacket and comfortable walking shoes. Midwest UX is hosted at two venues about a 10 minute walk apart and will feature excursions Friday afternoon throughout downtown, so there will be plenty of occasions for you experience the brisk fresh air Grand Rapids has to offer.

			%h4 Registration and Check-In
			
			%p Check-in will be open from 8am-5pm Thursday at <A href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=2-26+Pearl+St+NW%2C+Grand+Rapids%2C+MI+49503&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d1140!2d-85.6688211!3d42.9664639!3m2!1i1014!2i1199!4f13.1">KCAD Pearl</a> and at 8am Friday at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Urban+Institute+for+Contemporary+Art%2C+Grand+Rapids%2C+MI&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d4558!2d-85.668948!3d42.9663678!3m2!1i1014!2i1199!4f13.1">UICA</a>. Avoid the rush and get checked-in as soon as possible so you don't miss the Friday morning keynote!

			%p The workshops begin at 9am on Thursday and the first keynote of the main conference begins at 9am on Friday. There will be coffee and refreshments waiting for you!
		
			%h4 Meet Your Excursion Group for Lunch
			%p Meet your excursion group after sessions, 12:30 Friday at KCAD Pearl. Just look for the docent holding a sign with your excursion name and follow them for a complimentary lunch near the excursion venue. Get back to the UICA by 5:00 for the evening keynote, a chance to win conference prizes, and to pick up drink tickets for the gala.

			%h4 Transportation
			%p <strong>By Air:</strong> If you're arriving at Gerald R. Ford International Airport the most efficient way to <a href="http://www.grr.org/Ground.php">get downtown</a> is by taxi which will run you about $32. You can look for one outside the airport or call Metro Cab at 616-827-6500.
			%p <strong>By Land:</strong> <a href="http://www.downtowngr.org/map.php">Parking ramps are available</a> (cost is roughly $14 per day) near UICA and Kendall and on Saturday on-street parking is free on many streets (but pay attention to the posted times on meter)! For your convenience, you can pay parking meters by using the <a href="http://us.parkmobile.com/">Parkmobile app</a>.			
		
			%h4 Welcome Party
			%p Relax with us on Thursday at <a href="http://mcfaddensgrandrapids.com/">McFadden's</a> and get a drink, some hors d'oeuvres, and a good chat with everyone who has arrived.

			%h4 Gala Party
			%p Friday evening, don't miss the Midwest UX Gala by <a href="http://site-lab.org">SiTE:LAB</a>, an award-winning art exhibition in the rebooted former Grand Rapids Public Museum. Take in site-specific artwork by international artists while you enjoy appetizers, a cash bar and groove to the sounds of DJ Sonnrize. <a href="http://citizenshirt.com">Citizenshirt</a> will be printing t-shirts to order and stay alert to other surprises throughout the evening. 
			%p Did we mention you really shouldn't miss this party?

			%h4 Thanks!
			%p We're so glad you decide to join us and we are eager to welcome you to our city. We hope you'll have more than a great conference, we hope you'll have a great experience as well.
			%p 
				Excitedly,
