					%h3 Baking in A Theme
					%p So with an edge of daring we resolve to solicit talks germinated from an idea we are all familiar with as designers empathetic to what is meaningful in people’s lives. Their Place. Their identity, relationships, community and spaces.

					%h3 Our Place
					%p We share climate, geography, and the built environment. These places we live in become both communal and deeply personal. The dimensions of place not only inform what we do, they form who we are.
