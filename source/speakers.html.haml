			%p As you may know, West Michigan is a place that’s resplendent with autumn color in mid-October. However, did you also know that Grand Rapids is highly rated on national Top 10 lists for everything from Density of Designers per Capita to Best Beer Cities? But what’s even more exciting to us than showing off our city is curating a rich conversation about user experiences that support a sense of place.	
			%p We identify with the places in our lives because they have meaning to us personally and collectively. A place is often more than just a space: it can be the very embodiment of our understanding of the world gained from our experiences within it. From ourselves to our relationships to our spaces and our culture, <strong>life takes place</strong> and that is the challenge to us all as designers, makers and builders. So this October, join us for Midwest UX 2013 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It’s the place to be. 
			%p We’d like you to consider making a submission to MidwestUX 2013 in response to this theme. We encourage all submitters to consider putting together a talk or workshop that’s about place. Even - or especially - if it’s a talk or workshop you’ve never given before.

					%h3 The UX of Place
					%p The MidwestUX team has been coming together for months now in planning this conference. Each time the team assembles around the table in Grand Rapids, MI, we are all keenly aware of our sense of place, in our city, our community and our region. To create a holistic event experience, we are using three main principles that all encompass various aspects of the theme, as well as reflect what we do as professionals: Consider Context, Leverage Creative Collaboration, Build Human Experiences.

					%p It is with an edge of daring that we resolve to solicit talks germinated from an idea. 	An idea we are all familiar with as designers; empathetic to what is meaningful in people’s lives. Their Place. Their identity, relationships, community and spaces. How naturally can ‘Place’ play out in the talks yet to come? I have confidence in the experience of you, the designers, makers and researchers of the Midwest–our place–to tell the stories of your craft, your findings and your methods to inspire us on to making meaningful places.
