			%h1 Baking in A Theme
			%p.metadata By <a href="http://thinkxd.com/" class="name">Grant Carmichael</a> on May 6, 2013
			%p I’ve always enjoyed the opportunity to be involved in one way or another with design-related events, from TEDx to SiTE:LAB to Interactions to Midwest UX. I find that these designed experiences to me become places flowing with ideas, conversations, sometimes frustration but always energy. What is it about these events that make our minds drift back to them again and again?	
			%p I’ve shared many conversations with friends about how we’ve noticed at times a harmonious thread that connects the talks, the excursions, the workshops. Sometimes they can maddenly conflict. Synchronicity may emerge organically during the event, dictatorially or guided by a confident curatorial hand. We have big shoes to fill as the previous two Midwest UX events established an elegant and successful rhythm for a regional conference. Our intent is to find ways to help the threads knit ahead of the event and invite speakers to connect, share with each other and open up the doors of collaboration. 
			%p And then there’s theme. It’s a risk, it’s declarative. Dan Klyn put it best with this challenge to the team: “Do we sprinkle it on, or bake it in?” There was a comfort in just waiting to see what talks come in. But there can sometimes be a disconnect with theme once the programming is set. So with an edge of daring we resolve to solicit talks germinated from an idea. An idea we are all familiar with as designers; empathetic to what is meaningful in people’s lives. Their Place. Their identity, relationships, community and spaces. How naturally can ‘Place’ play out in the talks yet to come? I have confidence in the experience of you, the designers, makers and researchers of the Midwest–our place–to tell the stories of your craft, your findings and your methods to inspire us on to making meaningful places.
