					%h4 Creating Place — Using Sketch Mapping to Uncover Hidden Wayfinding Anchors
					%p Think about every successful user interaction design you've seen. Now imagine those designs without a way for the user to place where they are within the interaction.  We think you'll agree that successful user-experience designs require some kind of way-finding anchors so the user can orient themselves within the experience.
					%p Join this hands-on workshop to learn what sketch-mapping is and how it can help us discover and design the way-finding anchors that create the place within which user-experience emerges. You'll walk away with practical techniques you can apply in your next project.

					%h4 Making Places With Information Architecture and Content Strategy
					%p Whether we realize it or not, UX is largely the art of tailoring the experiences we design to our content: its semantics, hierarchies, relationships and meaning. Some of the most important work necessary to successful experiences happens before anyone starts to sketch an interface.
					%p Spend a half day exploring perspectives on how IA and Content Strategy provide important context that shapes user-experiences we design and learn learning new tools, techniques, and strategies for designing content-aware interfaces.

					%h4 Civic Engagement:  A Means to “Move” People from Place to Place
					%p UX isn't just about software and hardware interfaces. Its practices and principles can be vital to transforming the most important spaces we experience: the shape of our communities and built environments, what we experience from them, and how we change them for the better.
					%p This workshop focuses on the persuasion techniques needed to develop effective calls to action, mobilize support, and form valuable communities. When we get the message and approach correct, we have the potential to move our communities from one vision of our shared place to another.

					%h4 The Design Studio: Traditional Design Practice in a Place of Design Tradition
					%p Many working UX designers are the sole UX practitioner in their organization. Others they find themselves working in a place without a solid design practice. How do you integrate all the processes that give UX so much of its power into an existing workflow? Where do you turn for collaboration and outside perspective?
					%p This workshop gives participants the experience of working in a UX studio environment. We'll practice core aspects of the design process while working in small project teams. By tackling a real problem through teamwork and design practice, participants will better understand how they can integrate aspects of this process in their daily work lives.

					%h4 Design Studio for Context-Aware Products
					%p There is a tension growing between mobile product development trends, user behavior, and hardware capabilities. Our phones are becoming more intimately integrated with our everyday lives. They're acquiring sensory capabilities via hardware components and are growing evermore context aware. In the process, former best-practice design patterns are fraying at the edges. The result is that the design of systems to take advantage of these capabilities is lagging, and design patterns are fragmenting.
					%p This design studio will address these challenges with hands-on activities that move very quickly from idea generation to refinement to team consensus. You will work in small groups to define a problem space, explore multiple solutions, and combine ideas into a rough product sketch.

					%p Want to kickstart (or improve) your visual note-taking skills? Increase your visual IQ at the whiteboard during collaborative sessions? Hone your drawing capabilities in general? If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, this workshop is for you.
					%p We will directly confront the daunting challenge of drawing what we mean in real time and help you get past your drawing frustrations with practical tips for framing the contexts for drawings, engaging others in visual thinking, and improving your visual lexicon and lettering skills, all while having fun with sketching.

					%h4 Putting UX in its Place: UX research and strategy techniques for architecture, interiors, and urban spaces.
					%p This workshop will focus on how developing an understanding of users and their context enables diverse design disciplines to work together to influence, enhance, and even revolutionize the experience of place.
					%p We’ll apply those concepts in a rapid design challenge where your team will find a nearby space, conduct guerrilla research to identify potential design opportunities, and create an innovative UX concept which integrates online interactions to improve users' offline experience of place.

					%h4 Hey, You Got Your Map In My Territory!: The Role of Language in Placemaking
