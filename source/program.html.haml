					%h4 Making Places With Information Architecture and Content Strategy
					%p Whether we realize it or not, UX is largely the art of tailoring the experiences we design to our content: its semantics, hierarchies, relationships and meaning. Some of the most important work necessary to successful experiences happens before anyone starts to sketch an interface.
					%p Spend a half day exploring perspectives on how IA and Content Strategy provide important context that shapes user-experiences we design and learn learning new tools, techniques, and strategies for designing content-aware interfaces.

					%h4 Civic Engagement:  A Means to “Move” People from Place to Place
					%p UX isn't just about software and hardware interfaces. Its practices and principles can be vital to transforming the most important spaces we experience: the shape of our communities and built environments, what we experience from them, and how we change them for the better.
					%p This workshop focuses on the persuasion techniques needed to develop effective calls to action, mobilize support, and form valuable communities. When we get the message and approach correct, we have the potential to move our communities from one vision of our shared place to another.

					%h4 The Design Studio: Traditional Design Practice in a Place of Design Tradition
					%p Many working UX designers are the sole UX practitioner in their organization. Others they find themselves working in a place without a solid design practice. How do you integrate all the processes that give UX so much of its power into an existing workflow? Where do you turn for collaboration and outside perspective?
					%p This workshop gives participants the experience of working in a UX studio environment. We'll practice core aspects of the design process while working in small project teams. By tackling a real problem through teamwork and design practice, participants will better understand how they can integrate aspects of this process in their daily work lives.

					%h4 Design Studio for Context-Aware Products
					%p There is a tension growing between mobile product development trends, user behavior, and hardware capabilities. Our phones are becoming more intimately integrated with our everyday lives. They're acquiring sensory capabilities via hardware components and are growing evermore context aware. In the process, former best-practice design patterns are fraying at the edges. The result is that the design of systems to take advantage of these capabilities is lagging, and design patterns are fragmenting.
					%p This design studio will address these challenges with hands-on activities that move very quickly from idea generation to refinement to team consensus. You will work in small groups to define a problem space, explore multiple solutions, and combine ideas into a rough product sketch.

					%h4 Drawing What You Mean – in Real Time
					%p Want to kickstart (or improve) your visual note-taking skills? Increase your visual IQ at the whiteboard during collaborative sessions? Hone your drawing capabilities in general? If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, this workshop is for you.
					%p We will directly confront the daunting challenge of drawing what we mean in real time and help you get past your drawing frustrations with practical tips for framing the contexts for drawings, engaging others in visual thinking, and improving your visual lexicon and lettering skills, all while having fun with sketching.

					%h4 Putting UX in its Place: UX research and strategy techniques for architecture, interiors, and urban spaces.
					%p This workshop will focus on how developing an understanding of users and their context enables diverse design disciplines to work together to influence, enhance, and even revolutionize the experience of place.
					%p We’ll apply those concepts in a rapid design challenge where your team will find a nearby space, conduct guerrilla research to identify potential design opportunities, and create an innovative UX concept which integrates online interactions to improve users' offline experience of place.

					%h4 Introduction to Arduino and the Internet of Things
					%p Learn to apply your user-experience design skills to connected environments and the Internet of Things in this hands on workshop. Together we'll build several <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> projects that illustrate Arduino I/O basics including <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/blink">Blink</a> (the “hello world” of the Arduino), buttons, potentiometers, and LEDs.
					%p You'll also learn to plug a sensor in to the Arduino and have it communicate with your computer via <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, all while encountering real-world case studies. The additional $50 fee is to purchase the necessary hardware, which is yours to keep.

					%h4 Hey, You Got Your Map In My Territory!: The Role of Language in Placemaking
					%p We often think of content, metadata, names, or links, as stuff we put *into* the environment. But in fact, language is *part of* our environment. It shapes how we perceive where (and who) we are, and why. Discover how language should inform the semantic information we choose and principles we use when we design.

Have our neighborhood communities become silent places that merely house people on screens? Explore the next wave in maker culture hacking our sense of community with emerging experiments that challenge our notion of "place".

					%h4  Resistance is Futile: Google Glass and the Augmented Reality Cyborg Workforce of the Future
					%p Google Glass raises a number of questions: Should we design for it? *What* do we design for it? Who will use it? We'll explore how technology like Glass has already been prototyped, anti-prototyped, proven, and disproven for years in film, television, and literature. Learn how to harness these images to answer timely strategy questions and design products and apps able to transform the future.

					%h4 Turn About is Fair Play: How We Employed UX to Transform Our Workplaces and Rethink Our Business 
					%p If you're usually the vendor in a user-design experience project, it's eye opening to become the client. That happened to us recently when we redesigned our offices to leverage digital spaces and shrink our physical footprint. To us, this was an opportunity to rethink our business itself, increase our profitability, and improve our teamwork. Come hear about the initial challenges working with vendors, what we learned from being a client, how we we turned the tables and applied familiar UX techniques (like ethnography, needs analysis, and prototyping) to our office design, and how the resulting design transformed our business model.

					%h4 Field Manual: UX Lessons From The Military Profession
					%p Targets, strategy, impact, plans of attack—in the worlds of business and UX, we use military terminology without really understanding it. The military has learned from centuries of thought about leadership and mentorship techniques, infrastructure, empathy, and ways to...well, attack a problem. We'll examine what UX can learn from life on a military base, and be inspired by unexpected insights from the annals of military theory.

					%h4 The Essence of Experience
					%p The choices we make have consequences. As user experience designers, our values, assumptions, and the way we make decisions determine the essence of experience. What is the place of practicing UX based on values? This session draws upon design practice and discusses how to effect change without compromising yourself. Building on the most-debated Interaction'11 talk, this presentation is based on my forthcoming book <em>The Essence of Everything: Design, Ethics & the User Experience</em> (Morgan Kaufmann, 2014).

					%h4 Distant Land, Different Life
					%p Context and empathy are two words that have become increasingly ubiquitous – and rightly so. But how much do you truly understand about those from distant lands? We'll hear first hand what it’s really like to live in South Africa and confront how place provides a context that might influence our thinking and work. Come away with increased empathy for those whose experiences vary from yours thanks to the place they call home.
